# Jenkins-Demo
#### This Repo is used in Jenkins and it must be build automatic there.

## Build Triggers
### Difference between using Poll SCM and GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling:

## * **Poll SCM "Source Control Management"**:
   #### It periodically checks the repositories for changes.
   #### Jenkins periodically checks the version control system by comparing the current state with the previous state. If changes are detected, a build will trigger.
   #### It is used for projects with infrequent code changes.
 
   ### Configuration Of Jenkins Poll SCM:
    *** Step 1: Access Jenkins Dashboard
 
 
## * GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling:
 #### secondly start. :(
